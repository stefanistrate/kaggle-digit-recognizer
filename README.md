# Kaggle Digit Recognizer

Various solvers for the
[Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) task on Kaggle.
Currently, this repository provides 2 deep learning solutions:

* A CNN model that closely follows
[the TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers).
* A deeper CNN model with more convolutional layers than the one above and data
augmentation.
